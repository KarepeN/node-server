I’m currently pursuing my Masters’s degree in Applied Computer Science which will help me to improve my knowledge in web services, software development on multiple platforms.  I'm a transfer student,  joined for the summer intake in NWMSU.

I have done under graduation from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad. My hobbies are gardening, listening to music and painting. I have recently learned painting during summer break.

After my graduation, I would like to work as a full-stack developer. This course will help me learn and improve my knowledge on topics like JavaScript, Git and GitHub, HTTP and REST.

I’m a good team player, I was elected as the team leader for the projects during my under graduation.
